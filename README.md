# cyTRON: a Cytoscape app for the visualization of evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression
[TRONCO](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/TRONCO) is an R package that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of cancer progressions with the ultimate goal of understanding the evolutionary trajectories driving tumor evolution.

In such a multidisciplinary domain, where computer scientists actively cooperate with biologists, being capable of visually understanding the data is crucial to both parties.

**cyTRON** is a Cytoscape app that was designed for this purpose, i.e., mapping the features provided by the TRONCO R package to a user-friendly and accessible interface.

### Documents
The documentation of cyTRON is available at [docs folder](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/docs) of this project and includes
* an installation guide
* and a brief technical documentation that shows the class diagram and describes the used patterns.

### Google Summer of Code
cyTRON was developed within the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, in collaboration with [NRNB](http://nrnb.org/) (National Resource for Network Biology).

Here is the [link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5178892366118912) to the project.

#### Starting Point
The starting point of the GSoC project was the code included in the branch [base](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/base) of this repository.

#### Arrival Point
The branch [master](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master) at commit **AGGIUNGERE FINAL COMMIT** is the arrival point of the GSoC project.

All the differences between the branch base and commit **AGGIUNGERE FINAL COMMIT** represent the work carried out during the GSoC conding period.

The app is usable and will be soon uploaded to the [Cytoscape App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org).

#### Next
Even if the app is usable, there is room for improvement.

The list of enhancements, nice-to-have features and issues is available at the [issue page](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/issues) of this repository.
