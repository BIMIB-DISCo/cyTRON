# cyTRON: a Cytoscape app for the visualization of evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression
[TRONCO](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/TRONCO) is an R package that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of cancer progressions with the ultimate goal of understanding the evolutionary trajectories driving tumor evolution.

In such a multidisciplinary domain, where computer scientists actively cooperate with biologists, being capable of visually understanding the data is crucial to both parties.

**cyTRON** is a Cytoscape app that was designed for this purpose, i.e., mapping the features provided by the TRONCO R package to a user-friendly and accessible interface.

### Documents
The documentation of the cyTRON Cytoscape app is available at the [docs folder](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/docs) of this project and includes:
* the installation guide;
* a short technical documentation showing the class diagram and the adopted patterns.

In addition, we also provide an installable .jar file ([release directory](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/release)) together with a few example datasets ([datasets directory](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/datasets)).

### Google Summer of Code
cyTRON was developed within the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, in collaboration with [NRNB](http://nrnb.org/) (National Resource for Network Biology).

Here is the [link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5178892366118912) to the project.

#### Starting Point
The starting point of the GSoC project was the code included in the branch [base](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/base) of this repository.

#### Final Product
The branch [master](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master) at commit **AGGIUNGERE FINAL COMMIT** is the final product achieved at the end of the GSoC project.

All the differences between the branch base and commit **AGGIUNGERE FINAL COMMIT** represent the work carried out during the GSoC conding period.

The app is usable and will be uploaded to the [Cytoscape App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org).

#### Next Steps
Even if the app is usable, there is room for improvement.

The list of enhancements, nice-to-have features and issues is available at the [issue page](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/issues) of this repository.
