# cyTRON: a Cytoscape app for the visualization of evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression
[TRONCO](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/TRONCO) is an R package that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of cancer progressions with the ultimate goal of understanding the evolutionary trajectories driving tumor evolution.

In such a multidisciplinary domain, where computer scientists actively cooperate with biologists, being capable of visually understanding the data is crucial to both parties.

**cyTRON** is a Cytoscape app that was designed for this purpose, i.e., mapping the features provided by the TRONCO R package to a user-friendly and accessible interface.


### Google Summer of Code
cyTRON was developed within the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, in collaboration with [NRNB](http://nrnb.org/) (National Resource for Network Biology).

what work was done, 
what code got merged, 
what code didn't get merged, 
and what's left to do

It must be easy to identify the work you have done. (i.e. the changes you made or new code.)

public GitHub gist that describes the work you've done and links to the commits you've made and repositories you've worked on. 
If there is still work to be done on the project, include that too. 
You can also share highlights or challenging pieces.

Make sure the description clearly notes that this is for Google Summer of Code.
