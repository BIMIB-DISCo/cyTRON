# cyTRON: a Cytoscape app for the visualization of evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression 

[TRONCO](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/TRONCO) is an R package that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of cancer progressions with the ultimate goal of understanding the evolutionary trajectories driving tumor evolution. 

In such a multidisciplinary domain, where computer scientists actively cooperate with biologists, being capable of visually understanding the data is crucial to both parties. 

**cyTRON** is a Cytoscape app that was designed for this purpose, i.e., mapping the features provided by the TRONCO R package to a user-friendly and accessible interface. 

### Documents 
The documentation of the cyTRON Cytoscape app is available at the [docs folder](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/docs) of this project and includes: 
* the installation guide; 
* a short technical documentation describing the class diagram and the adopted patterns; 
* a case study example that replicates some of the results published in Caravagna, Giulio, et al. "Algorithmic methods to infer the evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113.28 (2016): E4025-E4034. 

In addition, we also provide an installable .jar file ([release directory](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/release)) together with a few example datasets ([datasets directory](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master/datasets)). 

### Google Summer of Code 2017 
cyTRON was developed within the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, in collaboration with [NRNB](http://nrnb.org/) (National Resource for Network Biology). 

Here is the [link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5141157457690624/) to the project. 

#### Starting Point 
The starting point of the GSoC2017 project was the code included in the branch [base](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/base) of this repository. 

#### Final Product
The branch [master](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/tree/master) at commit [41a1433](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/commit/41a1433247238342909f5a8d02d9b88f63f6fb01) is the final product achieved at the end of the GSoC2017 project. 

All the differences between the branch base and commit [41a1433](https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/cyTRON/commit/41a1433247238342909f5a8d02d9b88f63f6fb01) represent the work carried out during the GSoC2017 conding period. 

The app will be added to the [Cytoscape App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org).
